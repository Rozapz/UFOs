## Summary: 
One drawback of the website is that it does not show the distribution of sighting on a map. In addition user search options are not shown, country code names can help the user experience. 
One improvment tha could greatly change the website experience is to add a map distribution of the results in the website. This way it can be seen which states or cities have more sightings than others. Another improvement is additional filters added to website for shape and duration.
